# EE8603 - Red Wine Quality Multiclass Classification

## Abstract

In this study employing PyCaret, a red wine classification task was conducted using a fine-tuned Extra Trees (ET) algorithm with Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADSYN) to address class imbalance. The model's performance, evaluated across ten folds, revealed a moderate mean accuracy of 56.31%, mean AUC of 53.75%, and balanced recall (56.31%) and precision (59.29%) metrics. Confusion matrices and precision-recall curves were employed for a detailed assessment. Applying the tuned ET model to a new dataset yielded predicted labels and scores, offering insights into the model's ability to classify red wine based on chemical features. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the classification process and its outcomes, contributing to the understanding of red wine quality assessment through machine learning.
